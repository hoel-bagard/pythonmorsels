### Installation
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

#### Run pre-commit on all the files.
It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only run on the changed files during git hooks).
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```
